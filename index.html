        <h4>Renewable energy</h4>
        <p>Is the energy, the earth receives from the sun, primarily as visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The solar portal provides an overview of the information on energypedia related to solar energy. Look for specific topics, latest articles or uploaded documents and announce upcoming events</p>

        <p>  is useful energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The term often also encompasses biomass as well, whose carbon neutral status is under debate. </p>Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation,and rural (off-grid) energy services </p>

        <h4>power generation</h4>
          <p>Power generation
          By 2040, renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation. Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay.</p>
